      <li class="facts" id="fact2">The ocean covers 71 % of the Earth's surface</li>
      <p>It also holds about 96.5% of all Earth's water â€“ that's a volume of 320 million cubic miles! The globe
        illustration shows blue spheres representing relative amounts of Earth's water in comparison to the size of the
        Earth. Water is never sitting still. Thanks to the
        water cycle, our planet's water supply is constantly moving from one place to another and from one form to
        another.</p>
